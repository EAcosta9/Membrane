# Membrane
Membrane python

Model for a direct contact membrane distilation unit. Returns the flux and the temperatures 
at the feed and permeate side. Uses Dusty gas model to calculate mass flux, and energy balance 
in ordet to calculate interfacial temperatures. Will be updated with Monte Carlo method in order to 
calculate the mass flux.
